# Zendesk .gifs

Search animated gifs on Google Images and add them to your comments :)

**Work in Progress!**

## How to use it?
While you are writing a comment, search something on the "gif app search box":
![searchgif](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/743386/5086399/d44579cc-6f13-11e4-81b2-c0bd240254cb.png)

Once a picture appears you just need to click on it to confirm that you want to use it. Some markdown code will appear on your comment, and if you click on "Preview" you will see your gif.

**Note:** Remember that to get this working your comments need to accept markdown syntax. To enable this feature click on the gear icon on the left-sidebar to admin your account, and under Settings > Tickets the option "Agent comments processed by Markdown" should be checked.
